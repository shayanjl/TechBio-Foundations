# TechBio Foundations  
A structured collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the core components of a modern TechBio workflow.

This repository accompanies the TechBio book and provides practical, computational examples that mirror the concepts introduced in the text.  
Each notebook focuses on one key element of the TechBio pipeline, progressing from conceptual foundations to simple automation.

## 📘 Notebook Series

### **1. TechBio Flywheel**  
Introduces the fundamental learning loop that underpins modern TechBio platforms:  
**Biology → Data → Models → Validation → Improved Biology**.  
This notebook establishes the conceptual framework for all subsequent examples.

### **2. TechBio Data Pipeline**  
Demonstrates how raw laboratory output is transformed into structured, clean, and analysis-ready data.  
Includes column standardization, handling missing values, basic QC, and simple feature engineering.

### **3. TechBio First Model**  
Builds a minimal predictive model using the cleaned dataset.  
The aim is to illustrate workflow structure rather than deep machine learning theory:  
defining features, targets, splitting data, training, evaluation, and basic interpretation.

### **4. TechBio Learning Loop**  
Simulates an iterative learning cycle in which models guide experiments, and new experiments generate improved data.  
This notebook illustrates active learning behavior and the dynamics of model-driven experimentation.

### **5. TechBio Value of Scaling**  
A simple quantitative model showing how scaling the loop increases scientific, technical, and commercial value.  
Readers can adjust assumptions and observe how faster cycles, better assays, and automation compound value over time.

### **6. TechBio Automation**  
Introduces lightweight automation patterns suitable for small TechBio teams.  
Shows how to wrap workflows into functions, process multiple experiments in batches, and save outputs (cleaned data, models, metrics) for reproducibility.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository  

The goal of these notebooks is to make TechBio concepts **concrete and interactive**.  
They are designed as intuitive, minimal examples—large enough to be realistic, yet simple enough for readers to explore and modify without heavy prerequisites.

This repository is not intended to teach machine learning or biology in depth.  
Instead, it provides a clear view of how data, models, experiments, and automation fit together inside a TechBio platform.

## ▶️ How to Use  

1. Clone the repository or download the notebooks.  
2. Open them in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.  
3. Run the notebooks in order for the intended progression.  
4. Experiment with the adjustable parameters to test different scenarios.  

Every notebook is self-contained and uses only standard Python libraries.
