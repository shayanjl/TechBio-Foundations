# The TechBio Code Repository

A structured collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the core components of a modern TechBio workflow.

This repository accompanies the **TechBio** book and provides practical, computational examples that mirror the concepts introduced in the text. Each notebook focuses on one key element of the TechBio pipeline, progressing from raw data handling to platform economics.

## 📘 Notebook Series

### [1. TechBio Data Pipeline](1.%20TechBio_Data_Pipeline.ipynb)
**Chapter 4: The AI-Driven Lab**
Demonstrates how raw, messy laboratory output is transformed into structured, clean, and analysis-ready data.
* **Key Skills:** Column standardization, handling missing values, basic quality control (QC), and simple feature engineering.
* **Goal:** Understand that before AI can learn, data must be engineered.

### [2. TechBio Automation](2.%20TechBio_Automation.ipynb)
**Chapter 5: The Rise of TechBio**
Introduces lightweight automation patterns suitable for small TechBio teams.
* **Key Skills:** Wrapping workflows into functions, processing multiple experiments in batches, and saving outputs (cleaned data, models, metrics) for reproducibility.
* **Goal:** Move from running one-off analyses to building a reproducible pipeline.

### [3. TechBio Flywheel](3.%20TechBio_Flywheel.ipynb)
**Chapter 5: The Rise of TechBio**
Simulates the economics of a platform company versus a traditional lab.
* **Key Skills:** Modeling burn rates, defining learning rates, and visualizing the "Valley of Death".
* **Goal:** See the physics of survival and identifying the inflection point where a platform overtakes manual labor.

### [4. TechBio First Model](4.%20TechBio_First_Model.ipynb)
**Chapter 6: Building Biological Intelligence**
Builds a minimal predictive model using the cleaned dataset.
* **Key Skills:** Defining features and targets, splitting data (train/test), training a simple regressor, and basic interpretation.
* **Goal:** Illustrate the workflow structure of connecting biological data to machine learning predictions.

### [5. TechBio Learning Loop](5.%20TechBio_Learning_Loop.ipynb)
**Chapter 6: Building Biological Intelligence**
Simulates an iterative learning cycle where models guide experiments, and new experiments generate improved data.
* **Key Skills:** Active learning simulation, model-driven candidate selection, and tracking model improvement over time.
* **Goal:** Watch a "living system" improve itself through multiple cycles of experimentation.

### [6. TechBio Value of Scaling](6.%20TechBio_Value_of_Scaling.ipynb)
**Chapter 8: Building a TechBio Product Roadmap**
A quantitative model showing how scaling the loop increases scientific, technical, and commercial value.
* **Key Skills:** Adjusting platform variables (cycle time, batch size, assay noise) to observe how value compounds over time.
* **Goal:** Understand the math behind why faster loops create exponential value.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of these notebooks is to make TechBio concepts **concrete and interactive**.
They are designed as intuitive, minimal examples—large enough to be realistic, yet simple enough for readers to explore and modify without heavy prerequisites.

This repository is not intended to teach machine learning or biology in depth.
Instead, it provides a clear view of how data, models, experiments, and automation fit together inside a TechBio platform.

## ▶️ How to Use

1.  **Clone** the repository or download the notebooks.
2.  **Open** them in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.
3.  **Run** the notebooks in numerical order (1 through 6) to follow the book's narrative.
4.  **Experiment** with the adjustable parameters to test different scenarios.

Every notebook is self-contained and uses only standard Python libraries.
